# af3_kernels.py -- fused-kernel adapters for xfold (github.com/Shenggan/xfold @ 22bdeed, PyTorch AlphaFold3), H100, INFERENCE ONLY.
#
#   import af3_kernels as K
#   K.enable(["trimul", "triattn", "transition", "apb"])   # any subset; composable
#   ... run xfold as usual (torch.inference_mode + torch.autocast("cuda", torch.bfloat16), fastnn config = 'torch') ...
#   K.census()      # dict of served / fallback counters per lever (also printed once at interpreter exit)
#   K.disable()     # restores every patched class attribute
#
# All patches are CLASS-level monkey-patches of xfold classes (no weight edits, no instance surgery). Packed / recast weights are cached per module
# on `module._af3k` on first use (pack ONCE). Every lever fails safe: outside its served cell it calls the stock forward and counts the reason
# (printed once per distinct reason). Kernel exceptions disable that lever for the rest of the process and fall back to stock; an out-of-memory error propagates.
# Numerics classes: trimul / triattn / transition / apb = "same class as stock-under-bf16-autocast" (bf16 tensor-core operands,
# fp32 accumulation, fp32 LN/softmax statistics, stock rounding points; not byte-equal to stock; byte-equal run-to-run).
