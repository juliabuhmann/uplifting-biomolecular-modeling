"""af3_torch_opt — explicit interface to the PyTorch AlphaFold 3 port (xfold @ 22bdeed + OpenFold3-layout patches) running the converted
OpenFold3 parameters (preview-2 or openbind), with the kit's fused kernels and the DTK FusedDiT add-on.

    import af3_torch_opt
    report = af3_torch_opt.enable("fast")        # or "off"; resolves + gates on this box ("fast" is the package default; "off", the stock path, by name)
    af3_torch_opt.status()                       # the last activation report
    af3_torch_opt.check("off")                   # the dry run

or, without code: `af3-torch-opt pred --mode fast --json_path in.json --output_dir out` (== `python -m af3_torch_opt ...`,
== `run.sh pred --config h100 ...`), or `AF3_TORCH_OPT=fast` in the environment of that command.

The model is a Python API inside the kit (`opt/forward/af3t/af3_torch/af3_torch_api.py`) that needs the image's torch venv; its
featurisation and its output writers are the fork's (`sokrypton/alphafold3`, the image's JAX venv). The package therefore runs on its own
interpreter and composes three model processes per prediction (cli.py: featurise → forward → postprocess); it never imports torch, jax or
the fork, and nothing runs at interpreter start (`_autoload.py` applies nothing). `AF3_TORCH_OPT` in the environment is honoured by
the wrapper command only — under it, a direct import of the kit's api is refused (`NOT ACTIVE`, exit 3: that process cannot apply the
mode and would run stock under the variable), as is a value that is not a mode, and any undeclared `AF3_TORCH_OPT_*` name (`stack.gates`).

Modes (`modes.MODES`): "off" = the kit's eager set, no DTK (the port's own baseline),
"exact" = the stock-kernels base (xfold's shipped fastnn kernels) + the levers byte-equal to it (`registry.EXACT`: bf16 weights, the
whole-step-graphed sampler) + `template_dedupe` — `off`'s outputs byte for byte (xfold's shipped fastnn kernels); "fast" = the kit's `fastest` set + DTK
FusedDiT (tier 2), "big" = the memory line on the fast base. Two variants of the weights: the OpenFold3-preview2 parameters (`p2`) and the OpenFold3 openbind parameters (`ob`, OpenFold3 >= 0.5.0) — each the public checkpoint converted by the reference fork's converter (stock/PINS.json variants); a weights directory holds one, and the model process reads which off the converted records (xfold/params.py detect_variant).

The contract: `enable(mode, n_gpu=None)` returns the activation report (`active`, `mode`, `lever_set`, `levers`, `dtk`, `n_gpu`, `padding`,
the interpreters, `params_dir`, `cache_root`, `image`, `upstream`, `package_version`, `reason` when inactive);
`status()` the last report; `check()` the dry run; `cli.last_run()` the last pred's record (run_record.py). Every route runs
the pin gate first (`_core_gate.gate`, the core's kit template carried byte-for-byte: the importable `opt_core` must be the one
`opt/pyproject.toml [tool.opt_core]` pins — `NOT ACTIVE: reason=core_missing:opt_core` / `reason=core_mismatch: …`, exit 3) and then the
producers gate (`_producers.refuse_if_missing`: `reason=producer_missing:<modules>`, exit 3), before any `opt_core` import.
