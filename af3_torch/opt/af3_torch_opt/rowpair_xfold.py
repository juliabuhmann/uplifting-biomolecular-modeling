"""rowpair_xfold — the af3_torch ADAPTER of the shared core's row-sharded pair representation (``opt_core.mem.rowpair`` 0.4.3): what
``--mode big --n_gpu P`` (P > 1) runs in every rank of the model process (forward.py spawns the ranks through
``opt_core.mem.rowpair.launch.run_sharded``; users never type torchrun). Loaded BY PATH inside the model process (torch venv), never
imported by the wrapper package: it imports torch and xfold. At ``--n_gpu 1`` nothing here runs — every entry point refuses a P = 1 /
replicated layout by name (``opt_core.mem.rowpair.dist.require_sharded``) and the engine's own statements run unchanged.

Layout. xfold is unbatched: the pair representation is ``z[N, N, C]``, rows first. Rank q holds rows ``[r0_q, r1_q)`` of z — the core's
aligned row partition ``dist.Layout`` (``align``, default ``ALIGN``, handed to the core as ``ROWPAIR_CHUNK_ALIGN``): the trunk pair ``[R, N, 128]`` (bf16 under
the kit's autocast, fp32 between recycling iterations exactly as the engine casts it), the confidence head's per-sample pair ``[R, N, 128]``
(fp32, the engine's dtype), the conditioned diffusion pair ``z_cond [R, N, 128]`` and every ``[N, N]``-shaped head output as ``[R, N]`` rows.
Nothing ``N x N x c`` is ever whole on a rank. REPLICATED BY DESIGN (named in the schedule census ``xfold_replicated``): the single
representation ``[N, 384]``, ``target_feat [N, 447]``, the MSA representation ``[S_msa, N, 64]``, every per-token feature, every atom
tensor (atom cross-attention windows are sequence-local), the diffusion positions, the gathered triangle-attention bias ``[N, N, 4]`` per
attention call, and on rank 0 only the four ``[N, N]`` fp32 confidence matrices + the distogram contact map per sample
(``conf_full_matrices_rank0``: AlphaFold 3 writes full PAE / PDE / contact matrices and computes pTM / ipTM from them in its CPU
post-processing, so they are model OUTPUTS: assembled on rank 0's HOST column block by column block — never whole on any device).

What binds where (engine statement -> core seam; every callable below is the xfold module's OWN layers evaluated on a row block — a
per-(i, j) map or a GEMM whose M is the row count — so each element equals the dense statement's; the schedules, the communication and
every block size are the core's):

                                  REPLACED by the core's row schedule under P > 1 (gate word ``trimul=replaced:rowpair_rows``): with the trimul lever
                                  on, ``opt_core.mem.rowpair.trimul_fused`` runs its fused row kernels (K1 projection / K3 epilogue per tile) over
                                  these torch callables — their named fallback per unit, and the statements below the core's min_tokens pair size]

                                  roll-out entry, retired at the last pass's embed; the distogram head ran before the roll-out: forward_impl);

                                  pLDDT / experimentally-resolved = the dense statements on the replicated single (every rank)

Kit levers under P > 1: bf16w / triattn (flash) / transition (fused) / apb (SDPA on local query rows) / opm (its kernels per output row block of
the rank: opm_rows_kernel_fn) COMPOSE; trimul (FPF) is REPLACED by the core contraction; stepgraph is OFF (collectives inside a captured graph); hoist is REPLACED by the
per-roll-out z_cond rows + bias cache + banded encoder statics; DTK FusedDiT is SKIPPED by name (a whole-transformer fusion cannot serve local
query rows); compile composes (row-local modules). forward.py prints one LEVER line per name with these states.

Guarantee: tier 2 (``big`` never claims exact): the per-element arithmetic is the engine's, GEMM launch shapes differ in M, reductions inside
the fused kernels may reorder. The R1 guards (features, RNG state, diffusion positions bitwise identical across ranks) are always on.
